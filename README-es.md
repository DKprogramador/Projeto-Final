🦇 Wayne Industries
🚀 By: David Kaiky
This is my first project, and I dedicated myself to developing it. 
Initially, I tried integrating it with GitHub, but due to my lack of experience,
I faced conflicts when accessing it from another computer. Even so, after 26 days of work,
I restructured the code and finalized a functional version.

Although not all the desired features were implemented, 
I managed to deliver the essential ones. I see this project as the first of many!

📌 About the Project
